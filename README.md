Personal Project : Hon Hsing Athletic Club of Vancouver Website

This is an ongoing personal project to create an updated website of my martial arts club using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The previous website is outdated and uses a website builder called Wix.
The goal is to create a satisfactory and useable MVP that will then be continuously expanded upon to further my learning journey.
